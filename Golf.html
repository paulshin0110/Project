    <h2>What is Golf?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><i><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf" target="_blank">Golf</a></i> is played on a course, and the  <span style="color:green">green</span> area of the course is known as the fairway. The typical course consists of 18 holes. Golfers begin a play by standing at the teeing green and aiming the ball towards the putting green, the area where the flagstick and hole are located. The whole point of this is sport is that you put the golf ball into the hole with less strokes.

    <h2>History of Golf</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Golf was started in Scotland which was the first place to dabble in the game and create competitiveness within the sport.</b> Golf has been around since at least the 15th century, with the game being banned in Scotland during this time because the men responsible for protecting the country were preoccupied with golf rather than the needed archery practice. As the game evolved, golf clubs started forming and golf became the professional sport that we know today.</p><p>Historical golf balls were sewn up leather that was stuffed with feathers. Balls did not travel far and were easily damaged. Next golf balls were guttie balls which were designed from the rubber sap of a tree found in tropical areas. Other rubber and metal core balls were designed and used for certain periods of time. The United States Golf Association was the first entity to regulate golf balls during the 1930's. This led to the varieties of golf balls that we have today.</p>

    <h2>Scoring System</h2>
    <p>
    The goal is to play as few strokes per round as possible. A golfer's score is usually
    expressed as the difference between the player's number of strokes and the par <a href ="https://www.myonlinegolfclub.com/Information/GolfScoringMethods" target="_blank">score</a>. A
    hole in one (or an "ace") occurs when a golfer sinks his ball into the cup with his first
    stroke from the tee. Common scores for a hole also have specific terms.</p>
