        <h2>History of golf</h2>
        <p><b>Golf was started in Scotland which was the first place to dabble in the game and create competitiveness within the sport.</b> Golf has been around since at least the 15th century, with the game being banned in Scotland during this time because the men responsible for protecting the country were preoccupied with golf rather than the needed archery practice. As the game evolved, golf clubs started forming and golf became the professional sport that we know today.</p><p>Historical golf balls were sewn up leather that was stuffed with feathers. Balls did not travel far and were easily damaged. Next golf balls were guttie balls which were designed from the rubber sap of a tree found in tropical areas. Other rubber and metal core balls were designed and used for certain periods of time. The United States Golf Association was the first entity to regulate golf balls during the 1930's. This led to the varieties of golf balls that we have today.</p>
