    <h2>What is Golf?</h2>
    <hr>
    <article>
    <p><i><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf" target="_blank">Golf</a></i> is played on a course, and the  <span style="color:green">green</span> area of the course is known as the fairway. The typical course consists of 18 holes. Golfers begin a play by standing at the teeing green and aiming the ball towards the putting green, the area where the flagstick and hole are located. The whole point of this is sport that you put the golf ball into the hole with less strokes.Golf is one of the few ball games that do not require a standardised playing area. Instead, the game is played on a course, in general consisting of an arranged progression of either nine or 18 holes. Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole. There are various other standardised forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough, and hazards, but each hole on a course, and indeed among virtually all courses, is unique in its specific layout and arrangement. Golf competition is generally played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known simply as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes during a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at virtually all levels of play, although variations of match play, such as "skins" games, are also seen in televised events. Other forms of scoring also exist.
