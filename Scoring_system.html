<h2>Scoring System</h2>
    <p>
    The goal is to play as few strokes per round as possible. A golfer's score is usually
    expressed as the difference between the player's number of strokes and the par <a href ="https://www.myonlinegolfclub.com/Information/GolfScoringMethods" target="_blank">score</a>. A
    hole in one (or an "ace") occurs when a golfer sinks his ball into the cup with his first
    stroke from the tee. Common scores for a hole also have specific terms.</p>
