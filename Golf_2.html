    <h2>Basic Rules For Golfing</h2>
    <p>
        Unlike other sports, a golfer's real enemy is never his or her opponent but him/herself and more importantly, his or her surroundings.
That is one reason why the game has managed to keep a sense of sportsmanship at its heart - because even at the highest level golfers are united in their battle against the course as much as each other.
If you're new to the sport, either as a player or spectator, our guide to the basics will provide an insight into what it's all about.
